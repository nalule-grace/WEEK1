This is a breakdown of week1 Assignments.



1.Pointers
Asks  us to change the value of an integer x that has 2 pointers from another pointer and read it back via another.

In the main function a declaration of int x followed by 2 pointers p1 and p2

We store the adress of int x into the two pointer p1 & p2.
Print the first value of int and then refer a new value via p1 to the address of x.
Declare a new int "new that stores and assign it to pointer p2 and then print "new"



2.Swap
Declare a function swapValues that takes a pointer x and pointer y. Declare an integer "now" a temporary where our pointer x points.
We assign pointer x to pointer y and then pointer y to variable "now".
//THIS IS THE FUNCTION DOING THE ACTUAL SWAPPING"

In the main, we parse two values value1=35 and value2=-97.
A print statement prints the before values of each respective value.
A call to the swap function that takes value1 and value2 as parameters.
//This call initiates the swapping of values as per above function.

A print statement prints the after swap values respectively.



3.Arithmetic
In the main function,  an array 'aray' that takes 5 elements is declared. Followed by a pointer ptr that points to the last element in the array.

A while loop that takes the condition that ptr >= aray. And prints the value where pointer ptr is pointing. We then decrement ptr and the loops continues until our condition is met.



4.Generic
A function double arrayAdd that takes a pointer array and an int value.
A double variable sum is declared and equated to 0.0 (because its a double)
A for loop intiating i=0 and taking a condition that i< value then incrementing the value of i.
sum = sum plus the value of the element in the index "i" in our array.
then we return sum;
//this is the function performs summarizing.

In the main fiunction, an array "array that takes 5 elements id declared.
And the number of values is specified as 4.
a double variable result is declared that calls our function "arrayAdd and parses our new array and the specified number of values
A print statement that prints the sun of specified values and then the result.
return 0.
